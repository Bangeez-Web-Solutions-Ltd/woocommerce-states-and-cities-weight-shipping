Woocommerce Weight Based shipping for States/Regions/Cities

This WooCommerce plugin adds a shipping method that will allow you set the shipping fee for regions/states/cities by weight in a breeze. For places where the
shipping fee for various cities within the same region or state are not the same, this will help ease that process of setting up.
You can also choose top set the shipping fee for regions/states alone.

A good companion for this plugin is <a href"https://wordpress.org/plugins/states-cities-and-places-for-woocommerce/">States, Cities, and Places for Woocommerce</a> which transforms the cities form field
to a select dropdown and makes it easier to manage cities/local governments for states.
